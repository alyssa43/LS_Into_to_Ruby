What do the following expression evaluate to? That
is, what value does each expression return?

	1. x = 2  									=> 2
	2. puts x = 2								=> nil - becaue puts value is always returns "nil"
	3. p name = "Joe"						=> "Joe" - because the p method prints the output and returns the value
	4. four = "four"						=> "four"
	5. print something = "nothing" => nil - because like "puts", print always returns a value of "nil"
